# Binary and Decimal
In this assignment you'll be composing two methods based on the description
below. Complete the method templates provided in binary_and_decimal.rb file.

## Exercises
1. Write a method named `binary_to_decimal` that creates an array of size 8.
   Fill the array randomly with 0’s and 1’s. Print out the array so that it
   appears as a binary number. Calculate the decimal value for this binary
   number using the algorithm you devised in class. Print out the decimal value.
2. Write a method named `array_equals` that accepts two integer arrays as
   parameters. The method return `true` if the arrays contain the same elements
   in the same order, and returns `false` otherwise.
   Note: Do not use Array class methods for comparing the whole array at once.
   You may use array indexing to retrieve one element at a time,
   compare individual elements with each other and you may retrieve the length
   of an array.
